## My Personal Nix Config

> [!WARNING]
> **Use at your own risk.** It works _for me_, but it may not work _for you_. At least not without adjustments.

### Features

- **Flake-based**
- XFCE desktop environment
- BSPWM window manager
- Brave browser

  _**System configs**_: Configure various system components, like home-manager, unfree software, system-wide packages, etc.

- [`packages/`](./packages/) (directory)
