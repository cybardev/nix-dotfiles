## My Personal NixOS Config

### Notes
- _May or may not work for you._
- Needs channels to be added from [NixOS/nixos-hardware](https://github.com/NixOS/nixos-hardware) and [nix-community/home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) _before_ applying config.
- **PS**: Make sure to use `home-manager` version `24.11`, not `master`.
