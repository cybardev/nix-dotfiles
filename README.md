# Nix Dotfiles

## My Personal Nix Config

> [!CAUTION]
> **OUTDATED README**: This used to be a channel-based configuration (now it's flake-based), and the installation instructions have become obsolete. Will update sometime in the near future, but until then it's best to refer to source files (except `install*.sh`).

> [!WARNING]
> **Use at your own risk.** It works _for me_, but it may not work _for you_. At least not without adjustments.
